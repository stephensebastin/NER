# NER
Named entity recognition:
    two majer stages involved in NER
       1. Named Entity Identification
       2. Named Entity Classification
       
       
 Named entity identification (the task is to correctly identify a named entity span without further classification, that
is, to retrieve all named entity tokens) and named entity classification (the task is to correctly classify the retrieved named entity tokens into a set of predefined
classes). Mostly, named entity recognition (NER) usually stands for both of the tasks performed jointly.


A standard set of classification features for the NE task includes a broad
variety of the following:
• current surface word form,
• word lemma (a morphologically motivated base or root form of the word,
usually an output of a morphological analysis. In a broader sense it can be
considered a label of the word in a word lexicon.),
• word stem (an automatic reduction of inflected and derived word form to
a base form, which necessarily does not have to be a morphologic lemma as
in previous item and it even does not have to be a valid word form),
• part-of-speech tags (POS tags),
• the previous items applied on a window of a predefined number of preceding
and following words,
• rule-based orthographic features describing the current or surrounding word
forms, such as word capitalization, first character capitalization, information
about special characters such as hyphens, dots, question marks, etc.,
• various regular expressions designed to reveal e-mail addresses, numbers,
phone numbers, days, months and years, depending on the task. For example,
time expression can be matched using the following regular expression
([01]?[0-9]|2[0-3])[.:][0-5][0-9]([ap]m),
• prefixes and suffixes of the current or surrounding surface word forms,
• capitalization patterns in current and surrounding word forms.
