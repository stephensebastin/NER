Named entity recognition:
    two majer stages involved in NER
       1. Named Entity Identification
       2. Named Entity Classification
       
       
 Named entity identification (the task is to correctly identify a named entity span without further classification, that
is, to retrieve all named entity tokens) and named entity classification (the task is to correctly classify the retrieved named entity tokens into a set of predefined
classes). Mostly, named entity recognition (NER) usually stands for both of the tasks performed jointly.
